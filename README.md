🪨✂️📄 Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic in a 
browser-based environment.


🎮 Demo

Play the game by clicking any of the buttons to make your move. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the result is displayed immediately.

🧠 How It Works

* When the user clicks on one of the buttons (rock, paper, or scissors), the user's choice is stored.

* The computer randomly selects its choice.

* The result is calculated based on traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

* The user’s choice, the computer’s choice, and the result are all displayed on the page.
